  <p>Information Gathered from the following sources &#38 a brief description of their importance</p>
  
<ul class="refs" type="square">
    <li>&#169 <a onclick="window.open(this.href,'_blank');return false;" href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Main_Page">Bulbapedia</a></li>
    <p>
      Launched in 2005 this is considered my most fans of the franchise the go to site for looking up information. It is built in a similar way to wikipedia (hense bulba-pedia). This site has nearly every peice of information pertaining to individual pok&#233mon and the games in general. The following can be found on this site with ease.
    </p>
      <ul class="tight">
        <li>Pok&#233dex entries</li>
        <li>Locations</li>

        <p>
          Pok&#233monDB was founded in 2008 and contains mostly the same information as bulbapedia and serebii. I mostly use this website when looking up information due to my more familiarity with its layout compared to alternative sites.

          One of the oldest Pok&#233mon communites on the internet, founded in 2000, while not as important today compared to Bulbapedia, Serebii, and Pok&#233monDB it is still an important part of the history of collecting Pok&#233mon information on the internet.

        <p>
          Founded in 1999, it is the oldest fan run Pok&#233mon site. Still used and updated this site is mosly now used to announce current and past events in games, the anime, and card game. Information found on this site pertaining to collecting information on pokemon is similar to bulbapedia and pokemondb but collected in a way that is much easier to search for people who remember the old internet.

        <p>
          Finally we have the offical Pok&#233mon website, while not as useful as fan sites it still has its place for more basic information.
